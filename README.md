# personalwebpage
The idea of this little personal project was create a simple but nice responsive website with HTML and CSS. Before I started coding it I used figma to embody the desing ideas that were in my head. 
In the process I had issues with the hamburger menu in the mobile version but I kinda sorted it out by doing an on scrool header.
